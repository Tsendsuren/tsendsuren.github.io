Throughout my PhD journey (2014-2021), I've had the incredible opportunity to delve into the captivating field of attosecond physics (\(10^{-18}\) sec). Based at the Max Planck Center for Attosecond Science, as part of the Max Planck/POSTECH Korea initiative, my focus has been on developing an attosecond beamline with a specific goal in mind: measuring attosecond charge migration in biologically relevant molecules.

Utilizing ultrashort deep-UV and attosecond XUV pulses, I've been on a quest to unravel the intricacies of molecular dynamics at the most fundamental level. It's been an exhilarating journey filled with challenges and discoveries.

If you're keen to learn more about my research and the fascinating world of attosecond chemical physics, I invite you to explore my full dissertation:
