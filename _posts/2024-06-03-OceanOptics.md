# Intro
With this program, you can easily connect to the OceanOptics HR4000 spectrometer and get readouts without installing any software.

## Getting Started

Before you can use this program to interact with your OceanOptics HR4000 spectrometer, you'll need to install the `python-seabreeze` library. This library serves as a bridge between the spectrometer hardware and your Python code, enabling seamless communication and data retrieval.

### Installation

1. **Install `python-seabreeze`**:

   To get started, you can install `python-seabreeze` using the following pip command:

   ```bash
   pip install seabreeze

Refer to the python-seabreeze documentation for more detailed installation instructions and to ensure compatibility with your operating system.

### Using the Program
Once you've successfully installed python-seabreeze, you can run the program to connect with your OceanOptics HR4000 spectrometer. 

### Live Spectrum Display
As you work with your OceanOptics HR4000 spectrometer, the program will continuously retrieve and display the real-time spectral data. This live spectrum display makes it incredibly convenient to monitor and analyze your data as you work with your setup.
