### Laser intensity conversion

```python
Intensity [au] = Intensity [W.cm2] / 3.51e16 
```

### Electric field strength
```python
E [au] = E [V/m] / 5.14e11
```

### Energy conversion
```python
Energy [au] = Energy [eV] / 27.21
```

### Time conversion
```python
t [au] = t [fs] * 1000 / 24.2
```

### Wavelength conversion
```python
lambda [au] = lambda [nm] * 18.89
```

### Angular frequency
```python
omega [au] = 45.56 / lambda [nm]
```
